cd ../backend
npm install
Set up MongoDB:

Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based service.
Configure the MongoDB connection URL in the backend code (if needed) - usually found in backend/config/db.js or a similar configuration file.
Start the development servers:

bash
Copy code
# Inside the client folder
npm start

# Inside the backend folder
npm start
Access the application:

Client: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the client-side application.
